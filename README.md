## Course Description
We will begin by covering the basics of the linux operating system to
familiarize everyone with working in a command line environment, editing plain
text files, using version control software (git) and running code. After
everyone is comfortable using linux we will move on to writing code in python.
Python is an interperated scripting language, meaning it runs code with no
compile step. We will then explore loops, math, and object oriented programming
through a series of projects.

## Course Workflow
1. Fork assignment repository in [github.com/mahackers](https://github.com/mahackers) or at [github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/7477180-mahackers).
1. Clone the forked repository to your computer using `git clone URL`
1. Read the `README.md` file which contains the project description and
   instructions. (We will also go over each assignment in class)
1. Write code / do the assignment
1. Run `python3 tests.py` to test the code.
1. Submit the code by creating a pull request to the main repo or by using
   github classroom.
